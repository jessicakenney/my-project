<h3>Past Experience Review</h3>
<h5>What is holding me back?</h5>
<br>
<h5> Technical </h5>
<p>I have significant Engineering Experience that I have been very excited to return to
with my new Epicodus Software Skills. What is holding me back? After an 8 year gap of
staying home to raise my children I am struggling to speak with ease about my
past experiences to accurately reflect my skillset. Frankly it's embarrassing. I dedicated
close to 20 years to my education and career, and after years of 3 children, life events,
and twists and turns, the details of my experience allude me, chipping away at my confidence,
and leaving me with fear of assembling a resume and interviewing. It is important to me to
represent my past in a way that feels good, so as a self-assigned topic, I'd like to take
the time today to review key concepts of my past experience as a refresher, and a step to the future. <a href="past/technical">More...</a>

<h5>Non-Technical</h5>

When I started my engineering career in the 90's there was not the attention and support there
is today regarding Women in Engineering. I feel proud to witness the change of times, but it
is not without the awarenes how I have been shaped by past experiences and am left feeling anxious
of what to expect returning to the workplace. Historically, I have shoved aside experiences that
I felt inappropriate because I loved my job and found it emotionally confusing how to navigate
such incidents. Moving forward, I aspire to find my voice with such issues with the guidance of
a mentor, and help advocate for other women who find themselves questioning behaviors in their
work environment.<em> I have a couple of women in my LinkedIn network that I look forward to
arranging discussions with.</em> </p>
